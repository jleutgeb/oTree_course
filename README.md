# oTree Course Materials

This repository contains the oTree course materials for an introduction to oTree. It is based on oTree 5.10.4 and works with Python 3.11.

The course covers 

* Setting up oTree on your machine (slide sets 00 and 01)
* Setting up a simple consent app (slide set 02)
* Programming a simple public goods game (slide set 03)
* Setting up a matching procedure that can be changed by session-wide treatment (slide set 04)
* Programming a second game where two sellers compete for one buyer (slide set 05)
* Advanced treatment setup that allows subjects in the same session to be in different treatments (slide set 06)
* Using html and javascript to control the look of pages (slide set 07)
* Graphical feedback using chart.js (slide set 08)
* Preparing your code for deployment (slide set 09)
* Using github (in an admittedly very crude way, I advise you to look into git yourself) (slide set 10)
* Setting up a server using heroku (slide set 11)
* A step-by-step checklist to run your own server (slide set 12)

Also, three zip files are included. 

* oTree_day1.zip contains the oTree folder after slide sets 00-02
* oTree_day2.zip contains the oTree folder after slide set 03
* and oTree_day3.zip contains the oTree folder after slide set 04.
